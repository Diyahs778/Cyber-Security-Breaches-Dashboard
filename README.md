# Cyber-Security-Breaches-project

### Dataset Information
 The dataset includes information related to cyber security incidents such as:
- Departments and branches
- Breach type
- Individuals affected
- Breach duration (days)
- Employees who identified breaches
- Estimated stolen data (GB)
- Country and branch location

### Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop – Dashboard development & visualization
- Microsoft Excel – Initial data handling
- DAX – Calculated measures and KPIs

# Project Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard developed to analyze cyber security breach incidents across departments, branches, employees, and countries.  
The dashboard provides a consolidated view of breach volume, employee impact, breach duration, and estimated stolen data to support better cyber security analysis and decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze total cyber security breaches
- Compare open vs closed breaches
- Identify the most breached departments and branches
- Understand impact on  and their involvement in finding breaches
- Analyze breach duration and severity
- Identify most affected countries and breach types

## Key Metrics & KPIs
- Total Breaches: 1055
- Open Breaches: 910
- Closed Breaches: 145
- Total Employees: 19M
- Employees Affected: 16M
- Secured Employees: 3M
- Affected Employees (%): 81.96%
- Secured Employees (%): 18.04%
- Average Breach Duration: 243.63 days
- Estimated Stolen Data: 138K GB

# Dashboard Pages & Analysis

## Overview
- Overall breach statistics
- Open vs closed breaches
- Affected vs secured employees
- Average breach duration
- Average employees per breach
- Estimated stolen data (GB)

## Department Analysis
- Open and closed breaches by department
- Most breached department (Department-15)
- Individuals affected by department
- Estimated stolen data by department
- Average breach duration by department

## Employee Ranking Analysis
- Employees who detected breaches
- Open, closed, and total breaches found by employees
- Estimated stolen data identified by employees
- Number of affected individuals found by employees

## Branch Analysis
- Open, closed, and total breaches by branch
- Individuals affected by each branch
- Estimated stolen data from each branch

## Summary
- Total, open, and closed breaches
- Individuals affected by type of breach
- Secured and affected employees (%)
- Most common breach type: Theft
- Most affected countries: United States and Canada
- Location-based breach distribution

## Key Insights
- Theft is the most common type of cyber security breach
- A large proportion of breaches remain open
- Department-15 shows the highest breach occurrence
- United States and Canada are the most affected countries
- Certain employees play a key role in identifying breaches
- Breaches have a high average duration, increasing risk exposure

## Project Use Case
- Cyber security monitoring and reporting
- Risk assessment and impact analysis
- Management-level decision support
